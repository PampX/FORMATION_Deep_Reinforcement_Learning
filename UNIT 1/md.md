Reinforcement learning is a framework for solving control tasks (also called decision problems) 
by building agents that learn from the environment by interacting with it through trial and error 
and receiving rewards (positive or negative) as unique feedback.


# Observation Space :

State : complete description of the state of the world (no hidden information)
Observation : partial description of state of the world 

# Action Space : 

Discrete : finite number of possible actions
Continuous : infinite number of possible actions

# Discount rate (gamma)

between 0 and 1 
The larger the gamma, the smaller the discount. This means our agent cares more about the long-term reward.
