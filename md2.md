# Two types of Value based methods

## State Value Function V(s)
It evaluates “how good the condition is” in a given policy.

Useful if you simply want to evaluate the condition, for example to understand whether a condition is “good” or “bad”.

## Action Value Function Q(s,a)
It evaluates “how good this action is in this state”, taking into account future consequences.

Useful for deciding which action to take, as it distinguishes between the various possible actions.
